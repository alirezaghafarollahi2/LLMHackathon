      "scientific understanding by exploring novel domains, identifying complex patterns, and uncovering\n",

      "One of the grand challenges in the evolving landscape of scientific discovery is finding ways to model, understand,\n",
      "and utilize information mined from diverse sources as a foundation for further research progress and new science\n",
      "discovery. Traditionally, this has been the domain of human researchers who review background knowledge, draft\n",

      "their findings. While these conventional approaches have led to breakthroughs throughout the history of science, they\n",
      "are constrained by the researcher’s ingenuity and background knowledge, potentially limiting discovery to the bounds\n",
      "of human imagination. Additionally, conventional human-driven methods are inadequate for exploring the vast amount\n",
      "of existing scientific data to extrapolate knowledge toward entirely novel ideas specially for multi-disciplinary areas\n",
      "like bio-inspired materials design where a common goal is to extract principles from Nature’s toolbox and bring it to\n",
      "bear towards engineering applications.\n",
      "The emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies presents a potential promising solution by enabling the\n",
      "analysis and synthesis of large datasets beyond human capability, which could significantly accelerate discovery by\n",
      "uncovering patterns and connections that are not immediately obvious to human researchers [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. Therefore,\n",
      "there is great interest in developing AI systems that can not only explore and exploit existing knowledge to make\n",
      "significant scientific discoveries but also automate and replicate the broader research process, including acquiring\n",
      "relevant knowledge and data [6, 7, 8, 9, 10].\n",
      "Large language models (LLMs), such as OpenAI’s GPT series [11], have demonstrated remarkable progress in diverse\n",
      "domains, driven by their robust capabilities [ 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]. These foundational general-purpose AI models\n",
      "[17, 18, 19, 11] have been increasingly applied in scientific analysis, where they facilitate the generation of new\n",
      "ideas and hypotheses, offering solutions to some of the intrinsic limitations of conventional human-driven methods\n",
      "[20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26]. Despite their successes, significant challenges persist regarding their ability to achieve the\n",
      "level of expertise possessed by domain specialists without extensive specialized training. Common issues include their\n",
      "tendency to produce inaccurate responses when dealing with questions that fall outside their initial training scope, and\n",
      "broader concerns about accountability, explainability, and transparency. These problems underscore the potential risks\n",
      "associated with the generation of misleading or even harmful content, requiring us to think about strategies that increase\n",
      "their problem-solving and reasoning capabilities.\n",
      "In response to these challenges, in-context learning emerges as a compelling strategy to enhance the performance of\n",
      "LLMs without the need for costly and time-intensive fine-tuning. This approach exploits the model’s inherent ability to\n",
      "adapt its responses based on the context embedded within the prompt, which can be derived from a variety of sources.\n",
      "This capability enables LLMs to execute a wide array of tasks effectively [ 27, 28, 29]. The potential to construct\n",
      "powerful generative AI models that integrate external knowledge to provide context and elicit more precise responses\n",
      "during generation is substantial [30]. The central challenge is to develop robust mechanisms for the accurate retrieval\n",

      "The construction of knowledge bases and the strategic retrieval of information from them are gaining traction as effective\n",

      "mining of vast scientific datasets, transforming unstructured natural language into structured data such as comprehensive\n",
      "ontological knowledge graphs [31, 32, 6, 33, 34]. These knowledge graphs not only provide a mechanistic breakdown\n",
      "of information but also offer an ontological framework that elucidates the interconnectedness of different concepts,\n",
      "delineated as nodes and edges within the graph.\n",
      "While single-LLM-based agents can generate more accurate responses when enhanced with well-designed prompts and\n",
      "context, they often fall short for the complex demands of scientific discovery. Creating new scientific insights involves a\n",
      "series of steps, deep thinking, and the integration of diverse, sometimes conflicting information, making it a challenging\n",
      "task for a single agent. To overcome these limitations and fully leverage AI in automating scientific discovery, it’s\n",
      "essential to employ a team of specialized agents. Multi-agent AI systems are known for their ability to tackle complex\n",
      "problems across different domains by pooling their capabilities [35, 23, 36, 37, 38]. This collaborative approach allows\n",
      "the system to handle the intricacies of scientific discovery more effectively, potentially leading to breakthroughs that are\n",
      "difficult to achieve by single agents alone.\n",
      "Building on these insights, our study introduces a method that synergizes the strengths of ontological knowledge\n",
      "graphs [39, 40] with the dynamic capabilities of LLM-based multi-agent systems, setting a robust foundation for\n",
      "enhancing graph reasoning and automating the scientific discovery process. Within this generative framework, the\n",
      "discovery workflow is systematically broken down into more manageable subtasks. Each agent in the system is assigned\n",
      "a distinct role, optimized through complex prompting strategies to ensure that every subtask is tackled with targeted\n",
      "expertise and precision. This strategic division of labor allows the AI system to proficiently manage the complexities of\n",
      "scientific research, fostering effective collaboration among agents. This collaboration is crucial for generating, refining,\n",
      "and critically evaluating new hypotheses against essential criteria like novelty and feasibility.\n",
      "Central to our hypothesis generation is the utilization of a large ontological knowledge graph, focusing on biological\n",
      "materials, and developed from around 1,000 scientific papers in this domain [6]. We implemented a novel sampling\n",
      "strategy to extract relevant sub-graphs from this comprehensive knowledge graph, allowing us to identify and understand\n",

      "in generating well-informed and innovative hypotheses. Such a method not only improves the accuracy of hypothesis\n",

      "structured approach promises to enhance the impact and relevance of scientific discoveries by ensuring they are\n",

      "The plan of the paper is as follows. In Section 2, we discuss our proposed LLM-powered multi-agent system for\n",
      "automated scientific discovery, outlining its main components and constitutive agents. Two approaches are discussed and\n",
      "compared: One based on pre-programmed AI-AI interactions, and another one utilizing a fully automated framework in\n",
      "which a set of agents self-organize to solve problems. Several examples are provided to illustrate the different aspects of\n",

      "2 Results and discussion\n",
      "LLMs have demonstrated a relatively high level of proficiency across a wide range of tasks, including question\n",
      "answering, hypothesis development, summarizing and contrasting ideas, processing complex information, executing\n",
      "tasks, and even writing code. However, conventional inference strategies often fail to produce sophisticated reasoning\n",
      "and detail in the generated data. By using a set of interacting models, and assigning distinct roles to LLM-based\n",
      "agents, effective multi-agent AI systems can be constructed. When combined with carefully crafted prompts and\n",
      "in-context learning from graph representation of data, these systems are capable of generating scientific ideas and\n",
      "hypotheses. We now present results from a several experiments we conducted with our proposed framework (details\n",
      "about implementation, see Materials and Methods section).\n",
      "2.1 Multi-agent system for graph reasoning and scientific discovery\n",
      "Figure 1 illustrates the outline of our proposed multi-agent model designed to automate the scientific discovery process\n",
      "based on the key concepts and relationships retrieved from a comprehensive knowledge graph developed from scientific\n",
      "papers (Figure 1a). This figure further showcases two distinct strategies deployed in this study for generating novel\n",
      "scientific hypotheses, both of which harness the collective intelligence of a team of agents. These strategies integrate\n",
      "the specialized capabilities of each agent, systematically exploring uncharted research territories to produce innovative\n",
      "and high-impact scientific hypotheses. The full description of the agents incorporated in SciAgents is listed in Figures\n",
      "S1-S4 in the Supporting Information.\n",
      "The key difference between these approaches lies in the nature of the interaction between the agents. In the first approach\n",
      "(Figure 1b), the interactions between agents are pre-programmed and follow a predefined sequence of tasks that ensure\n",
      "consistency and reliability in hypothesis generation. In contrast, the second approach features fully automated agent\n",
      "interactions without any predetermined order of how interactions between agents unfold, providing a more flexible\n",
      "and adaptive framework that can dynamically respond to the evolving context of the research process. This second\n",
      "strategy (Figure 1c) also incorporates human-in-the-loop interactions, enabling human intervention at various stages of\n",
      "research development. Such interventions allow for expert feedback, refinement of hypotheses, or strategic guidance,\n",
      "specification about certain materials, types or features, ultimately enhancing the quality and relevance of the generated\n",
      "scientific ideas. Moreover, the second approach provides a more robust framework where additional tools could be\n",
      "readily incorporated. For instance, we have empowered our automated multi-agent model with the Semantic Scholar\n",
      "API as a tool that provides it with an ability to check the novelty of the generated hypothesis against the existing\n",
      "literature.\n",
      "Figure 2 shows an overview of the entire process from initial keyword selection to the final document. We employ a\n",
      "hierarchical expansion strategy where answers are successively refined and improved, enriched with retrieved data,\n",
      "critiqued and amended by identification or critical modeling, simulation and experimental tasks and adversarial\n",
      "prompting. The process begins with initial keyword identification or random exploration within a graph, followed by\n",
      "path sampling to create a subgraph of relevant concepts and relationships. This subgraph forms the basis for generating\n",
      "structured output in JSON following a specific set of aspects that the model is tasked to develop. These include the\n",
      "hypothesis, outcome, mechanisms, design principles, unexpected properties, comparison, and novelty. Each component\n",
      "is subsequently expanded on with individual prompting, to yield significant amount of additional detail, forming a\n",
      "comprehensive draft. This draft then undergoes a critical review process, including amendments for modeling and\n",
      "simulation priorities (e.g., molecular dynamics) and experimental priorities (e.g., synthetic biology). The final integrated\n",
      "draft, along with critical analyses, results in a document that can guide further scientific inquiry.\n",
